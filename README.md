Usage
Enter node index to start the Professional README.md generator.

Use <SPACE> to separate lines or paragraphs for each prompt.

Pressing <ENTER> submits your answer.

To add a screenshot to any prompt, first create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README.md using the following syntax: ![alt text](/assets/images/screenshot-filename.png)

You can always edit the README.md file after generating it in order to correct any misspelled words or to enhance the document.

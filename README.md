## Installation

Node.js must be installed on your machine.

- The Inquirer Node package must be installed in the directory where your files are.  You can find the installation package here:
(https://npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

- Once finished installing the Inquirer package, type
```npm install``` in the directory where files are.

You are now ready to generate your README.md file!


## Usage 

- Enter ```node index``` to start the Professional README.md generator.

- Use `<SPACE>` to separate lines or paragraphs for each prompt.
  
- Pressing `<ENTER>` submits your answer.  

- To add a screenshot to any prompt, first create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README.md using the following syntax: 
```![alt text](/assets/images/```*screenshot-filename*```.png)```

-  You can always edit the README.md file after generating it in order to correct any misspelled words or to enhance the document.
